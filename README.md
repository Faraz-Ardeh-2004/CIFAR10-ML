# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. Our goal is to explore and compare different approaches to accurately classify these images.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset includes the following classes:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

We use 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Approaches

Our project explores two main approaches:

1. **Traditional Machine Learning Models**: We implement several classical machine learning algorithms, applying them to the flattened image data after dimensionality reduction using PCA.

2. **Deep Learning Models**: We develop various neural network architectures, from simple feedforward networks to more complex convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Models

### Machine Learning Models
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Neural Networks
1. Feedforward Neural Network
2. Multiple CNN architectures with varying complexity
3. Wide ResNet

## Results

Here's a summary of our key findings:

1. **Machine Learning Models**: 
   - KNN achieved an accuracy of X%
   - Random Forest reached Y% accuracy
   - SVM performed with Z% accuracy

2. **Neural Networks**:
   - Our basic feedforward network achieved A% accuracy
   - The best performing CNN architecture reached B% accuracy
   - The Wide ResNet model topped at C% accuracy

(Note: Replace X, Y, Z, A, B, C with the actual percentages from your results)

The CNN models significantly outperformed the traditional machine learning approaches, with the Wide ResNet showing the best overall performance.
